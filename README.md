# Calculator
Creating a calculator using python TKinter user interface

Overview on how the code works.

1. I have configured the screen resolution and background colour in the main 

2. I have configured/defined all the widgets in the main so that when the frame or window loads all the widgets will loaded and displayed in screen.
	Widgets used in calculator application - Entry, Button.


3. I have created three functions press(), clear() and equal().

	a. Press function is used to store the value we have enterd in the calculator and adds the current value to the previous value we have entered through concatination.
	b. Clear function is used to delete the text enterd in the entry widget.
	c. equal function is used to calculate the data we have entered in the entry and i have used eval function to calculate the expression coming through the press function.
		once the output is displayed all the details will be cleared in the equal function.
